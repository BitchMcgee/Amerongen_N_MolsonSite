		<h2>Achievable goals for sustainable brews</h2>
		<div class="consumption"><h3>Promoting Responsible Consumption</h3><p>We recognize that having effective quality partners is essential to successfully reducing
		the harmful use of alcohol. In the U.S., we partner with nationally recognized organizations such as the Responsible Retailing Forum in the U.S. and the Respect21® program to team
	  up with retailers and distributors to prevent underage access in college communities. We also maintain valuable partnerships with the Techniques for Effective Alcohol Management (TEAM)
	  Coalition and Training for Intervention Procedures (TIPS®), providing training for retailers as well as in stadium venues to promote responsible alcohol service and consumption that helps reduce drunk driving.</p></div>
		<div class="govern"><h3>Sustainability Governance</h3><p>Sustainability is a priority to our Board, embedded into our Company’s strategy and integrated into the expectations of our senior and other leaders.<br><br>
		Our Global Senior Director of Corporate Responsibility is accountable for driving and tracking progress against Our Beer Print 2025 strategy and goals. Our sustainability performance is regularly reported to our Chief Legal
		and Corporate Affairs Officer, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer, Chief People and Diversity Officer, Chief Growth Officer and, at least annually, to the Executive Leadership Team and directly to the Board of Directors.

		To enhance our sustainability governance and meet external stakeholder expectations, we will launch a Sustainability Leadership Council (SLC) this year to provide proper oversight of sustainability topics
		 across our integrated organization. The SLC will consist of executive leadership and senior managers representing key corporate functions, who are responsible for leading our performance against Our Beer Print 2025 goals.</p></div>

		<h2>Environment</h2>
		<div class="water"><h3>Making the Most of Every Drop</h3><p>We all know high quality water is crucial to sustaining life. For Molson, it's also the most essential ingredient in our product and plays
		a starring rols at almost every point of our production chain. That's why we're committed to leading water stewardship by protecting watersheds and exploring more ways to make the most of every drop.
		To achieve this, our water strategy is focused on working with farmers, NGOs and local municipalities to: <br>-Improve water efficiency and manage wastewater in our breweries<br>-Lead water conservation, improve
		soil health and biodiversity, and advance water restoration efforts in our brewery watersheds<br>-Reduce water use in our agricultural supply chain.</p></div>
		<div class="agriculture"><h3>Growing Bbest Practice in Agriculter</h3><p>We have also challenged ourselves to improve the water-use efficiency of our agricultural supply chain and malting operations by 10% by 2025.
		Great beer needs great barley – and that means working with dedicated farmers in our supply chain to produce some of the highest quality barley in the world. With our agricultural operations making up the largest portion
		of our water footprint, it's important for us to partner with farmers in our network to embed sustainable techniques and best practices in their operations. By 2025 we aim to source 100% of our agricultural brewing ingredients
		from suppliers who grow, produce and deliver in a manner that recognizes and embraces our sustainability standards.</p>
